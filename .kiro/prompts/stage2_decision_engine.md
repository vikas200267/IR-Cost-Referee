# Stage 2: Decision Engine & Analysis Framework

## Analysis Methodology

The Referee uses a structured decision framework to evaluate options fairly and transparently.

### Step 1: Constraint Mapping

Before comparing options, identify all constraints:

```
Budget Constraints:
- Hard limit: [amount]
- Soft limit: [amount]
- Flexibility: [yes/no]

Timeline Constraints:
- Implementation window: [timeframe]
- Go-live deadline: [date]
- Flexibility: [yes/no]

Technical Constraints:
- Compatibility requirements: [list]
- Performance thresholds: [metrics]
- Scalability needs: [requirements]

Compliance Constraints:
- Regulatory requirements: [list]
- Security standards: [list]
- Audit requirements: [list]
```

### Step 2: Option Decomposition

For each option, break down into measurable dimensions:

```
Option: [Name]

Cost Dimension:
- Initial investment: [amount]
- Annual operating cost: [amount]
- Hidden costs: [list]
- Cost trajectory: [trend]

Performance Dimension:
- Latency: [metric]
- Throughput: [metric]
- Reliability: [percentage]
- Scalability: [capacity]

Risk Dimension:
- Technical risk: [assessment]
- Vendor risk: [assessment]
- Operational risk: [assessment]
- Compliance risk: [assessment]

Effort Dimension:
- Implementation effort: [hours/days]
- Maintenance burden: [hours/month]
- Learning curve: [assessment]
- Team capability: [assessment]
```

### Step 3: Trade-off Matrix

Create explicit trade-off comparisons:

```
Option A vs Option B:
- Cost difference: [amount] ([percentage])
- Performance gain/loss: [metric]
- Risk change: [assessment]
- Effort change: [hours]
- Constraint satisfaction: [mapping]
```

### Step 4: Constraint Satisfaction Scoring

For each constraint, score how well each option satisfies it:

```
Constraint: [Name]
- Option A: [Satisfies/Violates] - [reasoning]
- Option B: [Satisfies/Violates] - [reasoning]
- Option C: [Satisfies/Violates] - [reasoning]
```

### Step 5: Sensitivity Analysis

Identify which assumptions matter most:

```
If [assumption] changes by [percentage]:
- Option A impact: [change]
- Option B impact: [change]
- Option C impact: [change]
- Recommendation shift: [yes/no]
```

## Decision Criteria (Neutral Presentation)

Present each option's strengths and weaknesses without ranking:

- **Best for cost optimization**: [Option] - saves [amount] but [trade-off]
- **Best for performance**: [Option] - achieves [metric] but [trade-off]
- **Best for risk reduction**: [Option] - reduces [risk] but [trade-off]
- **Best for simplicity**: [Option] - requires [effort] but [trade-off]
- **Best for flexibility**: [Option] - allows [capability] but [trade-off]

## Output Requirements

1. Present all options with equal depth
2. Use consistent metrics across comparisons
3. Quantify trade-offs where possible
4. Flag assumptions that could change outcomes
5. Identify missing information needed for better decisions
6. Avoid language that implies preference
